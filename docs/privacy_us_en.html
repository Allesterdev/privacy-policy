  <h1>Privacy Policy — BMI Calculator</h1>

  <p>Last updated: 2025-09-21</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    BMI Calculator does not collect, transmit, or share the inputs you provide for calculations with any external servers. All inputs and computed results are stored locally on your device only.
  </p>

  <h2>Advertisements and third-party data</h2>
  <p>
    The app displays ads provided by Google AdMob. Advertising providers including Google may collect information from your device for the purposes of ad delivery, personalization, and measurement (for example device and advertising identifiers, usage data, and ad interaction data).
    Such collection is carried out by the ad providers independently of this app's local data usage.
  </p>

  <h2>Analytics and Data Usage</h2>
  <p>
    This application uses Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous data about app usage, such as viewed screens and user interactions. Additionally, it uses Firebase Crashlytics to collect information about app crashes and errors in order to improve stability and performance. This data is used exclusively to improve the user experience and does not include personal or sensitive information. The collection of this data respects the user's consent preferences in accordance with European regulations, and is managed through Google's User Messaging Platform (UMP).
  </p>

  <h2>Consent for ads and changing preferences</h2>
  <p>
    For users in regions where consent is required (for example EU/EEA/UK), the app will use Google’s User Messaging Platform (UMP) to request consent for personalized ads on first use. Your choice (personalized or non-personalized ads) will be stored locally on the device and honored in subsequent app sessions.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can change your preference in the app settings. To change ad settings across Google services, visit: <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank">https://adssettings.google.com</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>How to change between personalized and generic ads:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Within the app:</strong> Go to app settings and change your ad preference</li>
    <li><strong>For all Google services:</strong> Visit the link above to manage your ad personalization settings</li>
  </ul>
  <p>

  <h2>California residents (CCPA)</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell personal information. Because the app does not collect personal information about users beyond what ad networks may collect independently, there are no user-specific personal data sales to disclose. If you believe we hold personal information about you and wish to exercise CCPA rights (access, deletion, or opt-out of sale), contact us at the email below and we will respond as required by law.
  </p>

  <h2>Opt-out and ad settings</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Google ad settings: <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank">https://adssettings.google.com</a></li>
    <li>Google privacy policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
    <li>Ad technologies: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>
    This app is not intended for children under 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
  </p>
