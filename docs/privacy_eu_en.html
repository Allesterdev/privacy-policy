  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    IMC Práctico does not collect or transmit the inputs you provide for calculations to any external servers.
    Inputs and results are stored only locally on your device and are not shared or uploaded.
  </p>

  <h2>Ads and third-party data collection</h2>
  <p>
    This app displays advertisements provided by Google AdMob. Third-party advertising networks (including Google) may collect certain information from your device for ad delivery and measurement (for example, device identifiers, advertising identifiers, and information about ad interactions).
    This data collection is performed by the ad networks, not by this app's core functionality. We do not combine personal data collected by ad networks with any personal data collected by the app (because the app does not collect such data).
  </p>

  <h2>Consent for ads (EU / EEA / UK)</h2>
  <p>
    When you open the app for the first time, a consent form managed by Google’s User Messaging Platform (UMP) will be shown to request permission for processing data for personalized ads. Based on your choice, the app will show personalized or non-personalized ads.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your preference is stored only on your device (the choice and timestamp are recorded) and the app will honor it going forward. If you do not consent to personalized ads, the app will request that ad providers serve non-personalized ads where possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can change your preference at any time in the app settings. To change ad settings across Google services, visit: https://adssettings.google.com
  </p>
  <p>

  <h2>How to control ads and personalization</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Manage your Google ad settings: https://adssettings.google.com</li>
    <li>Learn about Google’s privacy practices: https://policies.google.com/privacy</li>
    <li>Google’s advertising technologies: https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data retention and storage</h2>
  <p>
    Any values you enter into the app (for example height, weight) remain on your device only. They are stored locally and are not transmitted to our servers or to third parties by the app itself.
  </p>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>
    This app is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
